# Educational Feedback
  As a team, we decided to develop this project based on the lessons we learned during our Multiverse workshops. Here are the lessons we implemented into our project, week by week.

  # Week 1 : UI Design Principles
  - Implementation of effective use of whitespace (or negative space) to improve the visual appeal and readability of the UI as well as support visual consistency across the website. 
  - Adequate spacing between elements provides breathing room and helps prioritize information. 
  - Incorporation of accessibility, using the WCAG Accessibility Principles of (1) perceivable, (2) operable, (3) understandable, and (4) robust.

  # Week 2: CSS Frameworks
  - Discussed best practices for planning components.
  - Based on the above discussion, we decided to utilize pre-written CSS styles and components that provide a foundation for web development.
  - Covered topics such as modular component building and maintainability.

  # Week 3: State Management
  - Discussed the principles and techniques of managing application state effectively.

  # Week 4: Front End & UI Testing
  - Explore the importance of testing in front-end development, along with its effect on UX.
  - Discuss the different techniques and methodologies used in front-end testing.
  - Cover unit, integration and end-to-end testing. 
  # Weeks 5: Routing
  - Angular Router provides a powerful and flexible routing system. Developers can define routes using the RouterModule and Routes classes. Angular Router supports features like lazy loading of modules, route guards for authentication and authorization, and nested routing.
